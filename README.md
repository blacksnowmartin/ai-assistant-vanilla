# ai-assistant-vanilla
The codes in this repository provide a basic chat interface where a user can type a message and get an AI-generated response. The vanilla and React versions work similarly, though React uses component-based states and hooks.

The React version can be found on this link https://github.com/blacksnowmartin/ai-assistant-react
